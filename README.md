# MiniTasks-App
this is a simple tasks App in which you can choose from a certain collection of tasks and add them to your tasks, those tasks 
will be saved permanently once you saved them into your tasks, you also add them to the completed or deleted tasks once you finished
them or they are no longer important.
this project uses NSDefaultUsers to save the data permanently on device and a tableView to show the date nicely
